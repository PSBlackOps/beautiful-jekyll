The PS Black Ops team consists of:

Both Matt and John work in Cyber Security, and use PowerShell daily. This site, and the PSBlackOps github
organization are about sharing our knowledge and experiences with other people. This is our way of giving 
back to the community, as well as challenging each other to get better.
